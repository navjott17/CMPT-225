# DEque

Please write a complete C++ program that:

(a) Implements a struct of Students with proper member variables (between 2 to 5).

(b) Implement a class for a deque of Students using double-linked list with two member variables (front and back) and the following member functions: pushFront, pushBack, popFront, popBack, peekFront, peekBack, clear (clears the deque), isEmpty, count (returns the number of elements in the deque), and display.

(c) Test your implementation in the main. 

Make sure that your program does not have any memory leak. Also, please add pre-condition and post-condition comments for each function.
